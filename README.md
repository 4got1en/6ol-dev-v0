# 6ol.dev v0

This is the early foundation for the 6ol.dev landing page.

Created with only HTML during my DBD Founder Mode training.

## Layout plan:
- Hero header: "Designed for the Forgotten"
- Mission block
- Call-to-action link
- Footer with contact + GitHub

### Current Features (v0.1)
- Fully responsive on mobile devices (media queries)
- Animated quote bar with rotating affirmations (JavaScript)
- Smooth scroll behavior for anchor links
- Hover animations for links

This is the seed. It'll grow.
